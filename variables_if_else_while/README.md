# C - Variables, if, else, while

In this project I discovered and learned the basics of C 12 tasks.

*However, here are the requirements that have been requested:*


* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
* All your files should end with a new line
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project
* There should be no errors and no warnings during compilation
* You are not allowed to use system
* Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl


# **What does it do?**

## **An explanation of how each script or program works**


### **Task 0**
* [Positive anything is better than negative nothing](https://github.com/Aluranae/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/hello_world/0-positive_or_negative.c)

This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative.

* You can find the source code [here](https://github.com/hs-hq/0x01.c/blob/main/0-positive_or_negative_c)
* The variable n will store a different value every time you will run this program
* You don't have to understand what rand, srand, RAND_MAX do. Please do not touch this code
* The output of the program should be:
	* The number, followed by
		* if the number is greater than 0: is positive
		* if the number is 0: is zero
		* if the number is less than 0: is negative
	* followed by a new line

While using the _program_ will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative.
