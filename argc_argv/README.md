# **What does it do?**

## **An explanation of how each script and program works**


### **Task 0**
* [It ain't what they call you, it's what you answer to](https://github.com/Aluranae/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/argc_argv/0-whatsmyname.c)

Write a program that prints its name, followed by a new line.

* If you rename the program, it will print the new name, without having to compile it again
* You should not remove the path before the name of the program
